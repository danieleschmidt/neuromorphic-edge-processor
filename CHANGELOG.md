   stdp = STDP(tau_plus=20.0, tau_minus=20.0)
   
   # New (v0.3.x)
   from neuromorphic_edge_processor.algorithms.novel_stdp import STDPConfig, StabilizedSupervisedSTDP
   config = STDPConfig(tau_plus=20.0, tau_minus=20.0)
   stdp = StabilizedSupervisedSTDP(config)
   ```

2. **Monitoring API**: Monitoring interface simplified
   ```python
   # Old (v0.2.x)
   monitor = Monitor(interval=1.0)
   monitor.start()
   
   # New (v0.3.x)
   from neuromorphic_edge_processor.monitoring import AdvancedMonitor
   monitor = AdvancedMonitor()
   monitor.start_monitoring()
   ```

   # New (v0.2.x)
   model = SpikingNeuralNetwork(layer_sizes=[784, 128, 10])
   ```

2. **Configuration Format**: YAML configuration structure updated
   ```yaml
   # Old format (v0.1.x)
   model:
